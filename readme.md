# AngPastes

A very simple project made with express, mongodb for the backend and EJS + bootstrap 4 and FontAwesome.js for the Frontend. 

## **It was made for portfolio and learning purposes.**

**It's not finished yet**, does not have user config panel or admin panel, I plan to finish it soon (tm)



Till now you can:

* Register new users (It asks for email, but it does not confirm it)
* Add/edit/delete pastes (Pastes are restricted to 10 000 characters for the body and 100 for the title). Pastes are privated, only the ones who have the url will have access to the paste.
* You can add and modify a password for your pastes.
* You can edit your email, your password and delete your account (It will remove all the pastes as well).

## I plan to add new things in the following days/weeks. Simple todo list (It's an unordered list, I will add them as I see fit):

* [x] ~~Protected pastes (You can add and modify a password, but it's not working yet)~~
* [ ] RECaptcha protected pastes
* [x] ~~User panel config~~
* [ ] Admin panel
* [ ] Maybe user profiles where others can see your pastes if you have them set as public (Not really a fan of this, but Idk)
* [ ] Anonymous pastes
* [ ] User ranks


### Instalation and usage:

```bash
npm install
npm start

```
